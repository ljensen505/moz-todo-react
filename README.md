# React Practice

This simple app was built with React and followed an [MDN tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks/React_todo_list_beginning).

It is a simple to do list that uses React Hooks, along with some minimal styling.

It has been deployed through Heroku and can be found [here](https://link-url-here.org)
